As a foreigner myself who came to Germany for studies, I've been fascinated by the cultural richness 
foreigners bring. Their skills and ideas can fuel innovation, but adapting to a new language and 
customs can be challenging for both newcomers and the host community. This sparked my curiosity 
about foreigner trends in Germany. 
The chosen dataset (12521-0001:Foreigners: Germany, reference date, sex/age years/marital
status) from the Genesis database (https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online) contains 
data regarding yearly from 1967 to 2023 the number of male and female migrated to Germany. 
From the dataset at hand, I would like to find out the following:
1. How has the total foreign population in Germany grown between 1967 and 2023?
2. Has the gender balance among foreign residents shifted significantly during this period?
3. Are there specific years with a surge in immigration for either men or women?
4. Are there decades where one gender consistently migrated to Germany at a higher rate than the other?
5. Identifing the top 5 years with the highest total foreign population.
